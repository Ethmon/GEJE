# 3D Graphics Engine From Scratch

A custom 3D graphics engine built entirely in C# without using any game engines or graphics libraries. The engine implements real-time 3D rendering, perspective projection, and multi-threaded architecture to create a fully functional 3D visualization system.

![Engine Demo](/api/placeholder/400/200)

## Core Features

The engine implements:
- Real-time 3D rendering with perspective projection
- Custom matrix mathematics for 3D transformations
- Multi-threaded architecture for parallel processing
- Triple buffering system with direct memory access
- Depth sorting and backface culling
- JSON-based 3D model loading
- First-person camera controls

## Technical Implementation

### Efficient Rendering Pipeline
```csharp
unsafe
{
    byte* ptr = (byte*)bmpData.Scan0;
    for (int y = 0; y < bmpData.Height; y++)
    {
        for (int x = 0; x < bmpData.Width; x++)
        {
            // Direct pixel manipulation for maximum efficiency
        }
    }
}
```

### 3D Mathematics
```csharp
public static double[,] GetRotationMatrixY(double angle)
{
    double cosTheta = Math.Cos(angle);
    double sinTheta = Math.Sin(angle);

    return new double[,] {
        {cosTheta, 0, sinTheta, 0},
        {0, 1, 0, 0},
        {-sinTheta, 0, cosTheta, 0},
        {0, 0, 0, 1}
    };
}
```

### Multi-threaded Architecture
```csharp
public void Update()
{
    Thread renderThread = new Thread(new ThreadStart(RenderLoop));
    Thread updateThread = new Thread(new ThreadStart(UpdateLoop));
    renderThread.Start();
    updateThread.Start();
}
```

## Technical Challenges Overcome

### Performance Optimization
Initial implementation suffered from severe performance bottlenecks. Solved through:
- Direct memory access for pixel manipulation
- Triple buffering system implementation
- Matrix calculation optimization
Result: Achieved stable 60+ FPS with complex scenes

### Depth Management
Implementing proper depth sorting required:
- Efficient depth sorting algorithm
- Backface culling implementation
- Robust projection matrix system
Result: Accurate rendering of overlapping objects in 3D space
